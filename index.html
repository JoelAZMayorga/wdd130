    <p>
      hi!, mi name is Joel Mayorga, i'm from Argentina, i love programming and games development. <br>

      I am from a city called Villa Mercedes in the province of San Luis, 
      I was a missionary in the Chile Santiago Sur Mission, 
      I served there for less than a year because of the coronavirus. <br>
      Due to the pandemic we had to return to our country, after A few days in a hotel,
      I was reassigned to the Salta Argentina Mission, we spent several months without 
      being able to go to the province of Salta, due to Covid-19 restrictions.<br>
      I am currently a logistics student at a college here in my city, I am also a programming fan, 
      I am working independently on a 2D RPG Video Game, due to my studies, 
      I have had to slow down the development of this my first video game, but I hope I can speed up work in mid-June. <br>
      In the next few years, I'll be working on 3D videogames, 
      as well as 3D, 2D animations, and much more videogames either on my own, or with a work team.
